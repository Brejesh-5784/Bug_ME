# Fake News Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

This project implements a Fake News Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). The system uses a Logistic Regression classifier with a TF-IDF vectorizer to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake**.

## üìä Project Overview

This project provides a **web app** built with **Streamlit**, which allows users to paste or type a news article to determine whether it's real or fake. The model is trained on a dataset of news articles and labels (real or fake), utilizing NLP techniques such as TF-IDF for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Web framework for creating the interactive interface.
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine Learning library for training and evaluating models.
- **TF-IDF**: Feature extraction technique for text data.
- **Logistic Regression**: Machine learning algorithm used for classification.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK**: For text processing and stopwords removal.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the model.

## üìù How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detector.git
   cd fake-news-detector
   ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries**  
   Install the necessary libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Datasets**  
   Ensure that you have the **Fake.csv** and **True.csv** datasets for training the model. You can find these datasets in public repositories or use your own data.

4. **Run the Streamlit App**  
   Launch the Streamlit app using the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will open the app in your default browser.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   The news dataset is loaded, and text data is cleaned. The titles and content of news articles are merged, and unwanted characters (URLs, special characters) are removed using regular expressions. The text is also converted to lowercase and stopwords are filtered out.

2. **Model Training**  
   The data is split into training and testing sets. A **Logistic Regression** model is trained on the **TF-IDF** features of the cleaned text data. Hyperparameters are tuned using **GridSearchCV** to find the optimal configuration for the model.

3. **Prediction**  
   Once the model is trained and saved, the Streamlit app allows users to paste text into a text area. The text is processed in real-time, and the model predicts whether the news article is real or fake.

4. **Web Interface**  
   The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the model. It uses Streamlit components to display a title, input field, and prediction results.

## üìä Model Performance

The model is evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy**, **classification report**, and **confusion matrix**.

## üíæ Model Storage

The trained model is saved using **Joblib** and can be loaded for future use in prediction tasks.

```python
model = joblib.load("model.pkl")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The accuracy of the model may vary depending on the quality and distribution of the training data.
- The app may need adjustments for larger datasets or real-time applications.

## üìÖ Future Improvements

- Implement advanced models like **BERT** for better accuracy.
- Integrate external APIs for dynamic data collection.
- Improve the UI for better user experience.
